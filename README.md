# Project - Predicting Yelp Ratings

For this project, I employed logistic regression using both sci-kit learn and maximum likelihood estimation to classify a businessâ€™ Yelp rating. The data was sourced from [Yelp's Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge). My ultimate goal was to create a tool to help illuminate the effect of Yelp-specific levers on ratings via a beta coefficient analysis. <br/>
